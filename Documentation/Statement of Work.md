Statement of Work (To be finalised after client meeting)

Introduction:
Over the course of two semesters our team aims to create a program which is able to automatically extract important information like new species names and classifications from biological reports and store them in existing databases.

Purpose:
Automating what is currently a manual process will save time, effort and money.

Scope:
The project entails converting a pdf into a text document, using various techniques to determine which words are relevant (possibly including analysing naming conventions, machine learning and frequency analysis), searching existing databases and finally entering data into a database through an existing API.

Milestones:
- Complete description of project objectives and requirements compiled
- Systems design finalised
- Functional OCR implemented (PDF to text)
- Text classification reached functional level
- Database search through API implemented
- Text classification works well
- Database upload through API implemented
- System passes testing

Preliminary Schedule:
1.Setup( 1 week):
- Research some relevant biology/taxonomy information
- Identify risks and risk management solutions
- Create a github project
- Decide on preferred programming language and tools
2.Research requirements(1 week):
- Analysis clientsâ€™ requirements and decide on their difficulty and time requirement
3.Software design( 2 - 3 weeks):
- Design software structure
- Design specific system functions
- Design database interactions and format
- Perform any necessary technical research 
4. Software development( 6 - 8 weeks):
- Implement OCR
- Implement text classification
- Implement database searching
- Implement adding to database
- Potentially implement some form of UI
5. Testing software(  2 weeks):
- Create software testing plan
- Create software testing use cases
- Implement software testing methods
6. System commissioning( 2 weeks):
7. Documentation and Audit Preparation (6 weeks)
- Finalise documentation for design, development and testing

Success Criteria
The project will be defined as a success as long as extracting and classifying names can be automated to an extent where a significant amount of time can be saved through the implementation of our solution.
