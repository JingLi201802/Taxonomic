## Introduction
Our project aims to automate taxonomic data capture from scientific reports, something which is currently performed manually. This information can then be uploaded to searchable databases where it can be accessed by the public. Automating this process will save our client time, effort and money which can be better spent elsewhere.

## Product Value
Our project has high academic and economic value. The project will help our clients improve their data collection efficiency, which can save a lot of time for them. Also, the project output software is working on automatic data collection. Therefore, they can reduce labor consumption and save a lot of money. In addition, this project is working for an open source academic website, the success of our project will help many people improve their data searching speed on this web site.
## Client Expectation
The client expects us to achieve some sort of functionality in terms of analysing documents in pdf form and returning scientific names present. At this point the client's expectations are not entirely clear and we intend to work with them to develop a concrete idea of what we are supposed to achieve with our project over the course of this week.

## Milestones
- Functional webclient interface
- Enable uploading pdfs and viewing them as plain text in sub-window
- Enable customising extractable tags
- Implement automated IBRA7 region calculation
- Successfully use GoldenGate to tag pdfs
- Analyse and maximise the success rate of GoldenGateâ€™s tagging
- Analyse and maximise the success rate of tag extraction
- Propose XML schema which will allow trivial data extraction

## Schedule
Week 6:
- Finalise higher level documentation (schedule, roles, milestones, audit ppt)
- Prepare for audit

Teaching break week 1:
- Thoroughly investigate GoldenGate
- Inquire about getting a web server set up with the ANU
- Create lower level documentation, ie. pseudocode, overall program structure, algorithms and testing plan
- Begin to design UI.

Teaching break week 2: 
- Complete development on basic interface, xml tag extraction and IBRA classification
- Complete basic UI
- Begin working on integrating GoldenGate with the server
- Prepare for audit

Week 7-8:
- Continue Work on implementing GoldenGate interpreting of PDF files server-side (backend)
- Create tools which allow the user to test the validity of output and fix it if necessary (frontend)
- Try to implement audit feedback

Week 9:
- Create project poster
- Meet with client and get feedback regarding program interface
- Work to improve efficiency and accuracy of data classification and extraction

Week 10:
- Overall system testing
- Finalise documentation
- Prepare for audit

Week 11:
- Implement audit feedback
- Prepare handover resources

# Risk Management
As the project is being implemented as part of a secure system, it is important that it does not present any new vulnerabilities to that system. This can be achieved by being considerate of the environment in which our project will be deployed and using appropriate programming techniques.
