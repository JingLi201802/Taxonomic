## Introduction
Our project aims to automate taxonomic data capture from scientific reports, something which is currently performed manually. This information can then be uploaded to searchable databases where it can be accessed by the public. Automating this process will save our client time, effort and money which can be better spent elsewhere.
## Client Expectation
The client expects us to achieve some sort of functionality in terms of analysing documents in pdf form and returning scientific names present. At this point the client's expectations are not entirely clear and we intend to work with them to develop a concrete idea of what we are supposed to achieve with our project over the course of this week.

## Schedule
1. Setup( 1 week):
- Research some relevant biology/taxonomy information
- Identify risks and risk management solutions
- Create a github project
- Decide on preferred programming language and tools
2. Research requirements(1 week):
- Analyse clientsâ€™ requirements and decide on their difficulty and time requirement
3. Software design( 2 - 3 weeks):
- Design software structure
- Design specific system functions
- Design database interactions and format
- Perform any necessary technical research 
4. Software development( 6 - 8 weeks):
- Implement OCR
- Implement text classification
- Implement database searching
- Implement adding to database
- Potentially implement some form of UI
5. Testing software(  2 weeks):
- Create software testing plan
- Create software testing use cases
- Implement software testing methods
6. System commissioning( 2 weeks):
7. Documentation and Audit Preparation (6 weeks)
- Finalise documentation for design, development and testing
## Risk Management
As the project is being implemented as part of a secure system, it is important that it does not present any new vulnerabilities to that system. This can be achieved by being considerate of the environment in which our project will be deployed and using appropriate programming techniques.
