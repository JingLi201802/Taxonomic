          <p>Type a name into the search form above.</p>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>You will get suggestions as you type in your query, they tell you what your query will return, and you can select one for an exact match.</li>
              <li>The query is <b>not</b> case sensitive.</li>
              <li>This search uses an automatic wild card at the end of the query to match all endings (unless the query is in double quotes).</li>
              <li>The query is an ordered set of search terms, so viola l. will match "Viola L." and "Viola L. sect Viola."</li>
              <li>Putting double quotes around your entire query will cause it to be matched exactly (except case). e.g. "Viola L." will match just Viola L.</li>
              <li>You can use a % as a wild card inside the search query e.g. hakea elon% be or "hakea % var. elon% benth." to find "Hakea ceratophylla var. elongata Benth."</li>
